Thanks for your review @weaverryan and @bocharsky-bw. I fix the syntax issues you point out, rename webmamba to symfonycasts, and now the user reference directly app.scss as in the last comment. Tell me what you thinks about all this changes! Cheers 😁🧡

I think i have a feature request to be considered before this is merged.

The request is to support compiling/watching more than one scss file.
This is required to support [page specific css](https://symfony.com/doc/current/frontend/asset_mapper.html#page-specific-css-javascript), and to migrate effectively from "multiple entrypoints" in webpack encore.

this is supported fine by the cli:
https://sass-lang.com/documentation/cli/dart-sass/#many-to-many-mode

this would require changing the `root_sass` configuration option to an array node to accept multiple paths

That makes sense to me. I can’t immediately think why this would cause any major issues.

@bendavies thanks for your review! I implemented the support for multiples sass files. 😁
